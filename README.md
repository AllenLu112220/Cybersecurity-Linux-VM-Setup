## **Task 4: Reflection and Analysis**  

### **1. Challenges in Detecting APTs**  
*(100â€“125 words)*  

	Detecting APTs is really tough because they are designed to stay hidden for long periods. They use sophisticated techniques to avoid detection, like encrypting their communications and blending in with regular network traffic. Instead of using obvious malware, they rely on tools already built into the system, like PowerShell and WMI, making them harder to spot. Since APTs move slowly and carefully, sometimes over months or even years, they don’t trigger immediate security alerts. This makes it difficult for organizations to realize they’ve been compromised until it’s too late. The combination of stealth, patience, and advanced evasion techniques is what makes APTs such a major challenge for cybersecurity teams.

### **2. Challenges in Defending Against APTs**  
*(100â€“125 words)*  

	Defending against APTs is equally challenging because these attackers are highly skilled and constantly adapting. They use zero-day exploits, meaning they take advantage of unknown vulnerabilities before companies can patch them. Another big issue is supply chain attacks, where APTs gain access through trusted third-party vendors, making it nearly impossible to block them completely. On top of that, social engineering tactics, like phishing emails, are still incredibly effective at tricking employees into giving away credentials. Even with strong security measures in place, human error remains a weak point. To stay ahead, organizations need to focus on continuous monitoring, better employee training, and staying updated on the latest attack techniques.

### **3. Insights from Researching APTs and MITRE ATT&CK**  
*(100â€“125 words)*  
	Researching APT groups and the MITRE ATT&CK framework has given me a much clearer understanding of how real-world cyber threats operate. I used to think cybersecurity was mostly about firewalls and antivirus software, but now I see how attackers use step-by-step strategies to break into systems and stay hidden. Learning about Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) has shown me how detailed and methodical these attacks can be. The MITRE ATT&CK framework is a great resource for understanding attack patterns and improving defenses. One thing that really surprised me was how APTs use everyday system tools instead of malware to avoid detection, proving that traditional security measures alone aren’t enough.

/usr/sbin/cron -f (PID: 600):
	The cron daemon is responsible for executing scheduled tasks. If you have numerous scheduled tasks running on this system, this process should be checked for potential performance issues or failing jobs.

/usr/lib/polkit-1/polkitd (PID: 587):
	This process is related to PolicyKit, a framework for defining and handling authorizations. It usually runs quietly in the background, but it's important to ensure that it isn't being hijacked or used maliciously. A higher-than-usual memory or CPU usage might suggest problems.
